# osdfir-infrastructure
This repository contains a set of Helm charts and deployment scripts that can be used to deploy Open Source Digital Forensics & Incident Response tools to a Kubernetes cluster. This is still early stages of development, but please stay tuned for instructions on how to install our official release. I look forward to sharing what is in store with the community soon!
